# Canadian Financial Regulatory Platform (CFRP)

### A Unified SupTech Platform for Canada's Financial Regulators

## Purpose
The CFRP is a cloud-native platform hosted on **Cloudflare + AWS (hybrid)** that digitizes and unifies supervision, compliance, and reporting for Canadian financial agencies including OSFI, FCAC, FSRA, AMF, and provincial regulators.

Our mission: To replace fragmented systems with a **single, secure, intelligent regulatory ecosystem** that enables:
- Real-time compliance
- Data transparency across jurisdictions
- Predictive risk analytics
- Streamlined user experience for institutions and regulators

Platform Tagline:
> "From Compliance Burden to Regulatory Intelligence."

## System Overview
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind + Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript + GraphQL  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + ElasticSearch  
- **Edge Services:** Cloudflare Workers, KV, Durable Objects  
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare for edge compute + AWS Aurora for secure data storage  
- **APIs:** REST + GraphQL + XBRL Data Exchange  
- **Security:** OAuth2 / OIDC (Keycloak or Cloudflare Zero Trust)

# Project Overview

## Vision
A single portal for all financial regulatory interactions in Canada. Today, financial institutions file identical data to multiple agencies using inconsistent formats. CFRP unifies data pipelines and provides a single dashboard for both regulators and institutions.

## Core Outcomes
1. **Single Reporting Portal** – one submission satisfies all agencies.  
2. **Proactive Risk Monitoring** – AI detects anomalies in filings.  
3. **Transparency** – shared data fabric across jurisdictions.  
4. **Cost Efficiency** – 60% compliance cost reduction.  
5. **Consumer Protection** – faster investigations, stronger oversight.

## Prototype Scope
- Cloudflare-hosted microservices (Workers + Durable Objects)  
- Secure APIs for agency access  
- Web portal for filing submission and validation  
- ML-based risk scoring sandbox  
- Case management dashboard

# Architecture Overview

## Cloudflare + AWS Hybrid
- **Frontend/UI:** Cloudflare Pages (Next.js)  
- **Edge Logic:** Cloudflare Workers for validation, routing, caching  
- **Data Processing:** AWS Lambda + Fargate (secure backend compute)  
- **Storage:** Aurora PostgreSQL + S3 (regulated data)  
- **Search/Analytics:** ElasticSearch + OpenSearch Dashboards  
- **Security Layer:** Cloudflare Access, Zero Trust, DDoS, WAF

## Design Principles
- Modular microservices  
- Event-driven processing  
- API-first interoperability  
- Multi-tenant and jurisdiction-aware data isolation
